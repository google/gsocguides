# Google Summer of Code Guides

This project contains the Google Summer of Code Mentor Guide and Contributor Guide.

## Template

The template and build is based on
<https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll>

Documentation can be found at
<http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/>

## Local Development

``` shell
# Build docker image (once)
make build-image

# Run server (listens on port 4000)
make serve
```

## Adding New Pages

If you're adding new pages between existing pages, use this script (or similar)
to renumber the existing pages.

```bash
for i in $(seq 28 -1 15);
    do n=$((i+1));
    fi=$(echo $i-*.md);
    fn=$(echo $fi | sed -e "s/${i}-/${n}-/");
    git mv $fi $fn;
    perl -pi -e "s/^order: $i\$/order: $n/" $fn;
done

# 28 is the current last page.
# 15 is the page to insert before.
# Iterate backwards to ensure there's only one page with each index at a time.
```

We need to do this because a) we're naming pages after their order, and b) the
Next/Prev button requires all the order numbers to be contiguous.  You can't
skip any.

## Upgrade Ruby Gems

```bash
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
bundle update github-pages
rm -rf vendor/bundle
```

Don't forget to rebuild the docker image!

## Run Markdownlint locally

```shell
npm install markdownlint-cli
./node_modules/.bin/markdownlint  pages
```
