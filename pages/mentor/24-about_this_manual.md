This guide was originally written during a Book Sprint sponsored by Google and
facilitated by FLOSS Manuals. The manual was written in two days but the
maintenance of the manual is an ongoing process to which you may wish to
contribute. A second sprint occurred in 2010 to update the manual (adding the
Org Admin section) and write the Students Guide ("Flipping Bits not
Burgers"). Another brief edit occured February 2017 to update and reflect the
new website and program changes.
