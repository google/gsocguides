We've collected our favorite and most useful resources specific to GSoC here.


## General Resources

If your organization has participated in GSoC previously, chances are there are mailing lists already set up and useful information in their archives; take a moment to look through them, especially around the launch times (February to March), community bonding period (April to May) and evaluation times (mid-July and end of August), for more details. The archives of the program mailing lists, particularly the private mentors list (below), are also quite useful.

No matter what, you want to take a look at the Program Rules each year to make sure you have a good idea of the rules for the program for both yourself and your students. There's a wealth of information included in the FAQs each year, even for experienced participants. You can always find the latest information, including a link to the FAQs, at <https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq>.

Additionally, these resources are quite helpful:

**Program IRC Channel**: Several knowledgeable folks (mentors, org admins, former students, current students and Google Program Admins) hang out in #gsoc on Freenode and would be happy to give you a pointer in the right direction.

**Blog Posts**: You can find material related to GSoC on the Google Open Source Blog at <http://google-opensource.blogspot.com>. Your project may have a blog or newsletter where GSoC information was published in the past, as well.

**Knowledge Base**: If you're looking for advice for mentors or students, program promotional materials, presentations about GSoC, etc., start with the program site <https://g.co/gsoc>, particularly the Resources section.

**Mentor Summit Wiki**: Google has traditionally held an annual mentor summit after GSoC wraps up each year. During the summit, many great discussions are held on all sorts of topics regarding the program and open source overall. Check out the summit wiki for session notes and to do some further collaboration. Instructions for getting a login account on the wiki are available on the private mentors list, or ping the program administrators for help. Anyone can view the wiki's contents at <http://gsoc-wiki.osuosl.org/>.

**List of Organizations**: You can see a list of the mentoring organizations that participated in previous years of the program by going to the program site and looking at the Archive site: <https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/past-summers>


## Mailing Lists

There are three program mailing lists.

**Announcement Only List**: For announcements from Google's program administrators only. Used infrequently.

<http://groups.google.com/group/google-summer-of-code-announce>

**Program Discussion List**: Open subscription list for the program. General talk about the program, light traffic except during the launch phase of the program each year. It is always excellent for you to stop by and encourage a newbie, though, so please don't totally ignore this list.

<http://groups.google.com/group/google-summer-of-code-discuss>

**Mentors List**: Private, invite-only list; mentors are subscribed to the list after their organization is accepted into the program and they opt in to the list during registration. This list is higher traffic at the beginning of the program and around the times of evaluations. Some great advice can be found on this list and in the archives, but it can also be noisy at times.

## What to Do When the Unexpected Happens?

**Contact your Organization Administrator**: He or she can help you figure out what to do next or contact Google for more help.

**Talk to Google's Program Administrators**: They have plenty of experience with all the corner cases and strange issues that can arise during GSoC. Email gsoc-support@google.com for help. You can also chat with Program Administrators on IRC during posted Office Hours as indicated on the Program website contact page.
