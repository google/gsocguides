We've collected our favorite and most useful resources specific to GSoC here.

## General Resources

Take a look at the Program Rules and Frequently Asked Questions to make sure you understand the rules of the program. There's also a wealth of information included in the FAQs and this guide, even for experienced participants. You can always find the latest information on the program site: <https://g.co/gsoc>

Additionally, these resources are quite helpful:

**Program Discord Channel**
We have a new Google Summer of Code Discord channel (discord.gg/google-dev-community) that is a space to talk about open source and the exciting things folks are learning, tips for others, and also ask others for suggestions if you are stuck, etc. It is not a support channel. For support from a Google Program Administrator, email gsoc-support@google.com.

**Program IRC Channel**

Several knowledgeable folks (mentors, org admins, former students, current contributors) hang out in #gsoc on [Libera.Chat](https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#gsoc) and would be happy to give you a pointer in the right direction. And many organizations have their own IRC channels that you can hang out in.

**Blog Posts**

You can find material related to GSoC on the Google Open Source Blog at <https://opensource.googleblog.com> Your project may have a blog or newsletter where GSoC information was published in the past, as well.

**Knowledge Base**

If you're looking for advice for mentors or students, program promotional materials, presentations about GSoC, etc., start with the program site <https://g.co/gsoc>, particularly the Resources section.

**List of Organizations**

You can see a list of the mentoring organizations that participated in previous years of the program by going to the program site and looking at the Archive site: <https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/past-summers>

## Mailing Lists

There are three program mailing lists.

**Announcement Only List**

For announcements from Google's program administrators only. Used infrequently.

<http://groups.google.com/group/google-summer-of-code-announce>

**Program Discussion List**

Open subscription list for the program. General talk about the program, light traffic except during the launch phase of the program each year. It is always excellent for you to stop by and encourage a newbie, though, so please don't totally ignore this list.

**GSoC Contributor List**

We have a program list for all accepted GSoC contributors. We add folks to the list based on their opting in to the GSoC Contributor list when registering for the program. This is only for current GSoC contributors and GSoC contributors/students that passed the program in previous years.

## What to Do When the Unexpected Happens?

1. Contact your Mentor. He or she can help you figure out what to do next or contact Google for more help.
1. Contact the Org Admin.
1. Talk to Google's Program Administrators. They have plenty of experience with all the corner cases and strange issues that can arise during GSoC.
