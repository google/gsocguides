## +1

The shortest way in the geek world to say "I agree with this" or "This is a great idea". It is often used when others have already fleshed out the details and a consensus of how many agree/disagree with the sentiment. It is worth noting to your students if your project uses this as a voting signal so they do not accidentally comment on issues when, as newbies, they should be observing rather than commenting/voting.


## -1

The opposite of +1. Often accompanied by an explanation why, if you are lucky.


## Committer

An individual who has special rights in an open source project. While the scope of this term varies by project, the general idea is that this individual is able to check in source code to the project's main repository.


## Community Bonding Period

The period of time between when accepted students are announced for a particular year of GSoC and the time these students are expected to start coding. This time is an excellent one to introduce students to the community, get them on the right mailing lists, etc. See the "Mind the Gap" section for more details.


## DVCS

## Secondary Mentor

A person who helps out a student's assigned mentor. At time of writing this manual, the GSoC online system only allows one mentor to be officially assigned to a student proposal, as one person must be responsible for submitting evaluations, etc. However, it is quite common to have multiple mentors for one student.
